# PyCharm Plugin for Ontology

Adds support for Ontology Smart Contract Development:

1. Contract Compilation (.py)
2. Contract Deployment (TestNet / MainNet / PrivateNet)
3. Contract Invocation (Payed / PreExec)
4. Contract Debugging (Step through / Breakpoints / Variables Preview)

## Requirements

1. Node runtime environment
2. `npm install -g ontdev`

## Usage

Please make sure the requirements above have been resolved.

When the project creating wizard appears, it will ask you where does the Ontdev locate at.
You could use `which ontdev` command to find and copy-paste the path, or click the `Choose` button to use `CMD+SHIFT+P` to
locate to the parent path of `ontdev` then click the file to choose it.
